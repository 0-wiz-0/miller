BUGFIXES

* circular subpackage dependencies involving join
* at least, move out test_argparse to unbreak that

================================================================
TOP OF LIST

----------------------------------------------------------------
MAJOR: release planning

* 2.2.1 with autoconfig
* 2.2.2 with CSV read-perf

----------------------------------------------------------------
MAJOR: autoconfig

* doc link for homebrew support ...

* port more deader-mains over to UT ...
  o files:
    ./input/lrec_reader_in_memory.c
    ./dsls/filter_dsl_wrapper.c
    ./dsls/put_dsl_wrapper.c

* manpage:
  - http://www.linuxhowtos.org/System/creatingman.htm
  - https://www.gnu.org/software/groff/manual/html_node/Man-usage.html
* solve the duplication problem, and minimize dependencies:
  - ideally mlr --manpage all in C
  - as a second choice, maybe generate most content in C with a post=processor
    in some widely portable language (e.g. perl is gross but is everywhere) to
    add in the groff markups.
  - or something template-driven vaguely like poki??
  - whatever it is is needs to be as automated as possible

LEVELS:
* figure out a2x/xml/...
* manpage
* poki
* ... what else ...

TO-DO:
* include lemon-generated .c/.h or not
* lemon in-dir -- cf wiz note
* gprof link with -lc on FreeBSD -- ?

----------------------------------------------------------------
MAJOR: scroll-stalls in mlrdoc!! really bad on the droid.

----------------------------------------------------------------
MAJOR: multi-char separators

* valgrind & UT cline/sline
* UTx4xN the format-parsers

----------------------------------------------------------------
MAJOR: csv mem-leak/read-perf

* current option runs faster w/o free, apparently due to heap-fragging
  o memory leak in csv reader! careful about slls data, and do not use lrec_put_no_free
  o redo inline-pasting but this time correctly weight the fragging effect
  o power-of-two
* for stdio, needs some thought ...
* ... but for mmap, it's almost always not necessary to strdup at all:
  only on escaped-double-quote case.
* denormalize the pbr & make stdio pbr & ptr-backed (mmap,UT-string) pbr.
* code-dup (yes, sadly!) the CSV reader into two & do strups in stdio
  but lrec_put w/ !LREC_FREE_VALUE for ptr-backed.
* or *maybe* pbr retent/free-flags for string/mmap w/o denorm, but only
  if it's both elegant and fast
! experimental/getlines.c shows that even without the heap-fragging
  issue, pfr+psb is 3.5x slower than getdelim. again suggesting
  multi-char-terminated getdelim might be the best line of approach.

----------------------------------------------------------------
MINOR

* define dkvp, nidx, etc @ cover x 2
  - web-server access logs in dkvp format -- ?

* go back and re-apply ctype/isprint portability things to new spots

* more dead-code mains ... lrec-eval; what else?

* dsls/ build outside of pwd? or just lemon $(absdir)/filenamegoeshere.y?
* configure w/o autotools? likewise manpage. etc. multiple build levels.

b mlr faq page

* --mmap @ mlr -h
* ctype ff @ bld.out
* platform os/ccomp list to mlrdoc

* -h vs. usage : stdout vs. stderr
* pprint join?

* header-length data mismatch et. al: file/line

* make an updated dependency list, esp. in light of a2x et al.
* probably its own mlrdoc page ... at least, highlighted in build page

----------------------------------------------------------------
little:

* RFC "there may be a header" -- ?!? use nidx-style integer-numbered columns?? --no-header?

* -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic-?? Werror=unused-but-set-variable?

* --mmap into online help ...

* comma-number -- using locale?

* poki cover -> readme

* steppers (and stats1/2 -- what else -- ?): include help-string in
  lookup table, and iterate over that in the online help function

NEATEN

!! xxx's in the code

? copyright headers ...

* source hygiene: top-of-header comments, readme re memory management, etc.

================================================================
COOKBOOK

* doc w/ very specific examples of sed/grep/etc preprocessing to structurize semi-structured data (e.g. logs)

================================================================
MEM MGMT:

* full void-star-payload frees
* multi-level frees in stats1/stats2/step subcmds (control-plane structures)
* multi-level frees in stats1/stats2/step hashmaps (data-plane structures)
* _free funcptr/funcs for mappers
* free last rec in streamer?
* look strdups at other lhm*
* look at any other strdups

================================================================
NIDX/DKVP/...:

* maybe have a mode where "a" (not "a=1") -> "a=" with dkvp and "1=a" with nidx? 3rd format? 3 flavors
  of one format??

* dkvp as generalization of nidx. restructure mlrwik to emphasize this.
  tightly integrate 'mlr label'. maybe rename 'mlr label' to 'mlr name' or
  some such.  perhaps entirely coalesce nidx&dkvp in the code & the docs;
  presumably with a different name.  something about "header with data" or
  "key with value"?? lower-cased only rather than making it an acronym?

* nidx via field widths; left/right space-strip -- *only* if headers also don't have whitespace!!!

* maybe call dkvp labeled-index fmt
* definitely put nidx before dkvp in the mlrwik/formats page
* "index-numbered" -> "implicitly index-numbered" in mlrwik

================================================================
FUNCTIONS
? match   (b_ss)  (w/ regexes!!)
? gsub    (s_sss) (w/ regexes!!)
? index   (i_ss) -- not very useful unless there are functions which take an index as an argument ...
? bit ops (i_ii) & | ^ << >>
? log2, exp2

================================================================
UT/REG
* general coverage
  - include -D__XXX_MAIN__ content
* cat/X/cat for all X
* tac/X/cat for all X
* cat/X/tac for all X
* tac/X/tac for all X
* multi-csv I/O: include --icsvlite --odkvp and --idkvp --ocsv, as well as --csv cases
* het-xtab out
* modulus operator
* strlen
* make should-fail machinery & use it for null-key dkvp cases.
* all mathlib funcs
* int/float/string
* roundm function: round to multiple of m
* boolean() function
* boolean-valued put, e.g. mlr put '$ok = $x <= 10'
* nullability cases, esp. sort, and math funcs
* join with het data
* join with mixed-format/separator (left vs. right)
* join with left/right-prefix
* mmap/stdio UTs; run all cases with --mmap and again with --no-mmap
* all __X_MAIN__ instances -> UT code (effectively all-but-dead code at present)

================================================================
DOC

* Note that PCA is better than OLS for roundoff error (sum of squares ...):
  grep red data/multicountdown.txt | head -n 13 | mlr --opprint stats2 -a linreg-ols -f t,count
  grep red data/multicountdown.txt | head -n 14 | mlr --opprint stats2 -a linreg-ols -f t,count

================================================================
IMPROVEMENTS

* free-flag for string mlrvals

* run go/d/etc on sprax & include #'s in perf pg, and/or rm xref in the latter & just post xlang perf #'s there
* link to gh/jk/m xlang impls ... and/or cardify their sources :) ... or maybe just link to gh/jk/m xlang dir
* ack c impl has been repeatedly optimized but even the original version (also cutc.c ...) outperforms

* make a -D for hash-collision stats ...

* update t1.rb including numeric sort; fix appropriateness of -t=

* mlr sort -f -nr x: probably should sweep through all subcmds & disallow args to start
  with '-'

================================================================
HARDER HYGIENE
* eliminate compiler warnings for lemon & its autogenerated code

================================================================
PYTHON
* pgr + stats_m same I/O modules??

================================================================
FYI

Semantic versioning:
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

* MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
* MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
* PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
