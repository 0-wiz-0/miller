POKI_PUT_TOC_HERE

<h1>File-format awareness</h1>

Miller respects CSV headers. If you do <tt>mlr --csv-input cat *.csv</tt> then the header line is written once:

<table><tr>
<td>
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{cat a.csv}}HERE
</td>
<td>
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{cat b.csv}}HERE
</td>
<td>
POKI_RUN_COMMAND{{mlr --csv cat a.csv b.csv}}HERE
</td>
</tr></table>

Likewise with <tt>mlr sort</tt>, <tt>mlr tac</tt>, and so on.

<h1>awk-like features: mlr filter and mlr put</h1>

<ul>

<li/> <tt>mlr filter</tt> includes/excludes records based on a filter
expression, e.g. <tt>mlr filter '$count &gt; 10'</tt>.

<li/> <tt>mlr put</tt> adds a new field as a function of others, e.g. <tt>mlr
put '$xy = $x * $y'</tt> or <tt>mlr put '$counter = NR'</tt>.

<li/> The <tt>$name</tt> syntax is straight from <tt>awk</tt>&rsquo;s <tt>$1 $2
$3</tt> (adapted to name-based indexing), as are the variables <tt>FS</tt>,
<tt>OFS</tt>, <tt>RS</tt>, <tt>ORS</tt>, <tt>NF</tt>, <tt>NR</tt>, and
<tt>FILENAME</tt>.

<li/> While <tt>awk</tt> functions are record-based, Miller subcommands (or
functions, if you like) are stream-based: each of them maps a stream of records
into another stream of records.

<li/> Unlike <tt>awk</tt>, Miller doesn&rsquo;t allow you to define new functions.
Its domain-specific languages are limited to the <tt>filter</tt> and
<tt>put</tt> syntax. Futher programmability comes from chaining with
<tt>then</tt>.

<li/> Miller is faster than <tt>awk</tt>, <tt>cut</tt>, and so on (depending on
platform; see also POKI_PUT_LINK_FOR_PAGE(performance.html)HERE). In
particular, Miller&rsquo;s DSL syntax is parsed into C control structures at
startup time, with the bulk data-stream processing all done in C.
