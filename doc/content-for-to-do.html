<li/> After the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10066742">release
announcment</a>, by far the biggest asks were RFC-4180-compliant CSV, and
packaging (Homebrew, <tt>.deb</tt>).

<li/> Miller&rsquo;s record, field, and pair separators can be single
characters (e.g. newline, comma, equals sign), optionally allowing repeats on
input (e.g. multiple spaces treated as one). Multi-character separator strings
(e.g. double-linefeed) are supported on input and output for CSV, and on output
for other formats.  This is a work in progress.

<li/> String-oriented functions such as <tt>sub</tt>, and Miller&rsquo;s
<tt>filter</tt>, could be made far more powerful if a regular-expression
library were included. Additionally, allowing <tt>RS</tt>, <tt>FS</tt>, and/or
<tt>PS</tt> to be regexes would be powerful.

<li/> Various other to-do items are listed
