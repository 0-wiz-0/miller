<ul>

<li/> Miller&rsquo;s record, field, and pair separators can only be single
characters (e.g. newline, comma, equals sign), optionally allowing repeats on
input (e.g. multiple spaces treated as one). It would be nice if strings were
supported, e.g. <tt>"\n\n"</tt> paragraph-oriented record separation, or mix of
space and tab for field separation.

<li/> Quoting isn&rsquo;t supported in CSV. For example, Miller splits
<tt>a,"b,c",d</tt> as <tt>a</tt> then <tt>"b</tt> then <tt>c"</tt> then
<tt>d</tt>.

<li/> String-oriented functions such as <tt>sub</tt>, and Miller&rsquo;s
<tt>filter</tt> could be made far more powerful if a regular-expression library
were included.
